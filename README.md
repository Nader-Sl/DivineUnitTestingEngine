## API Tester for BoL 2.0

# What is it?
This contains a special **API Tester** class and multiple **API tests** which help to find what is bugged out after new L patches.
Among present tests there are also few test-demos which demonstrate some bugs I've found.

# Hotkeys:
- **L** - runs **next** test
- **J** - runs **previous** test
- **K** - confirms test as **successful**, if Tester class runs in **manual mode** (self.auto = false)

If Tester class runs in auto mode (self.auto = true) - some tests may be performed automatically, in this case it will automatically start next test. Read console/chat during testing for more information.

# Important:
During automatic testing please don't use any spells and don't move your hero.
